project\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\nDev notes\nI will describe now the project works\nComponents\nThere are 3 components available:\n\napp.component\nmembers.component\nprint-ships.component\n\napp.component\napp.component.html\nIt shows the members.component template.\napp.component.sass\nNo style for now\napp.component.ts\nOnInit, it calls the function getMembers() from the members.component.\nmembers.component\n\nmembers.component.html\nmembers.component.sass\nmembers.component.ts\nUpdates\n\nStarCitizen API implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/membre.html":{"url":"interfaces/membre.html","title":"interface -
